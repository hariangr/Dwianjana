# Dwianjana
This is an open source data for my __Project Dwianjana__, a project of mine that I participated in a competition called **Millenial Techno Fiesta 2019** in Bali

As part of my presentation, and my contribution for education I would contribute these data (Machine Learning) that anyone could use (With permission, this is subject to change)

Although I don't have to publish this data since I only the 4th winner (I still believe I should be the first winner), I will still publishing these data for the reason I stated above

The presentation was held at **August 8th 2019** and the winner announcement at **August 14th** so I should publish it then, but I got busy with **University Orientation** stuff (I just finished yesterday, read more at https://blog.harianugrah.com/2019/08/my-first-back-to-hometown-story/)

I still seriously can't believe I lose... so unfair
